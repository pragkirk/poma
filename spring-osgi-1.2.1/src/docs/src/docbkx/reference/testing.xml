    <title>Testing OSGi based Applications</title>

    <para>By following best practices and using the Spring Dynamic Modules
    support, your bean classes should be easy to unit test as they will have
    no hard dependencies on OSGi, and the few OSGi APIs that you may interact
    with (such as <interfacename>BundleContext</interfacename>) are interface-based 
    and easy to mock. Whether you want to do unit testing or <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing">
    integration</ulink> testing, Spring DM can ease your task.</para>

     <title>Mocks vs Stubs</title>
     <para>There are various strategies to unit test code
     that requires collaborators. The two most popular strategies
     are <emphasis>stubs</emphasis> and <emphasis>mocks</emphasis>.
     </para><para>
     See <ulink url="http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">

    <para>
    Even though most OSGi API are interfaces and creating mocks using a specialized
    library like <ulink url="http://www.easymock.org/">EasyMock</ulink> is fairly
    simple, in practice the amount of code of setting the code (especially on JDK 1.4)
    becomes cumbersome. To keep the tests short and concise, Spring DM provides OSGi
    mocks under <literal>org.springframework.osgi.mock</literal> package.</para>
    
    <para>It's up to you to decide whether they are useful or not however, we make extensive
    use of them inside Spring DM test suite. Below you can find a code snippet that you
    are likely to encounter in our code base:</para>

			return reference;

		public ServiceReference[] getServiceReferences(String clazz, String filter) 
				throws InvalidSyntaxException {

     <title>What about JUnit4/TestNG?</title>
    
     <para>While JUnit4/TestNG overcome the class inheritance
     problem that appears when building base JUnit classes, by decoupling
     the runner from the test through annotations, Spring DM cannot use
     them since it has to support Java 1.4.</para>
     <para>However, it is planned for the future to provide an optional,
     JVM 5-based testing extension to integrate the existing testing framework
     with the aforementioned libraries.

    <para>In a restricted environment such as OSGi, it's important to test the visibility and versioning of your classes, 
    the manifests or how your bundles interact with each other (just to name a few).</para>

    <para> To ease integration testing, the Spring Dynamic Modules project provides a test class hierarchy
    (based on <classname>org.springframework.osgi.test.AbstractOsgiTests</classname>) that
    provides support for writing regular <literal>JUnit</literal> test cases that are then
    automatically executed in an OSGi environment.</para>
    
    <para>In general, the scenario supported by Spring DM testing framework is:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>start the OSGi framework (Equinox, Knopflerfish, Felix)</para>
      </listitem>

	<warning>The testing framework is aimed at running OSGi integration tests from a non-OSGi environment (like Ant/Maven/IDE). The testing framework
	is NOT meant to be used as an OSGi bundle (nor will it work for that matter). In practice this means that the testing bundle should be separate from the bundle(s) it
	tests (similar to unit testing, where tests are separate from the classes they test).</warning>    

    <para>By following this sequence it is trivial to write JUnit-based
    integration tests for OSGi and have them integration into any environment
    (IDE, build (ant, maven), etc.) that can work with JUnit.</para>

    <para>The rest of this chapter details (with examples) the features
    offered by Spring DM testing suite.</para>

      <title>Creating A Simple OSGi Integration Test</title>
     
      <para>
      While the testing framework contains several classes that offer specific
      features, it is most likely that your test cases will extend
      <classname>org.springframework.osgi.test.AbstractConfigurableBundleCreatorTests</classname> (at least
      this is what we use in practice).
      </para>
      <para>Let's extend this class and interact with the OSGi platform through
      the <literal>bundleContext</literal> field:</para>


    <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public class SimpleOsgiTest extends AbstractConfigurableBundleCreatorTests {

public void testOsgiPlatformStarts() throws Exception {
	System.out.println(bundleContext.getProperty(Constants.FRAMEWORK_VENDOR));
	System.out.println(bundleContext.getProperty(Constants.FRAMEWORK_VERSION));
	System.out.println(bundleContext.getProperty(Constants.FRAMEWORK_EXECUTIONENVIRONMENT));
	}
}]]></programlisting>
      
    <para>Simply execute the test as you normally do with any JUnit test. On Equinox 3.2.x,
    the output is similar to:</para>

    <programlisting><![CDATA[Eclipse
1.3.0
OSGi/Minimum-1.0,OSGi/Minimum-1.1,JRE-1.1,J2SE-1.2,J2SE-1.3,J2SE-1.4}]]></programlisting>    
    
    <remark>It is likely that you will see different log statements made by the testing
    framework during your own test execution, but these can be disabled as they only have an informative
    value and do not affect the actual execution.</remark>
    
    <para>Note that you did not have to create any bundle, write any MANIFEST or
    bother with imports or exports, let alone starting and shutting down the OSGi
    platform. The testing framework takes care of these automatically
    when the test is executed.</para>
    
    <para>Let's do some quering and figure out what the environment in which the tests run is.
    A simple way to do that is to query the <interfacename>BundleContext</interfacename>
    for the installed bundles:</para>
    <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public void testOsgiEnvironment() throws Exception {
	Bundle[] bundles = bundleContext.getBundles();
	for (int i = 0; i < bundles.length; i++) {
		System.out.print(OsgiStringUtils.nullSafeName(bundles[i]));
		System.out.print(", ");
	}
	System.out.println();
}]]></programlisting> 
    <para>The output should be similar to:</para>
    <programlisting><![CDATA[OSGi System Bundle, ObjectWeb ASM, log4j.osgi, spring-test, spring-osgi-test, spring-osgi-core, 
    spring-aop, spring-osgi-io, slf4j-api, 
spring-osgi-extender, etc... TestBundle-testOsgiPlatformStarts-com.your.package.SimpleOsgiTest, 
]]></programlisting>

    <para>As you can see, the testing framework installs the mandatory requirements required for running the 
    test such as the Spring, Spring DM, slf4j jars among others.</para>

       declare what classes they need or offer to other bundles.
       Most libraries are OSGi unaware and do not provide the proper manifest

       to provide the proper manifest - please see the FAQ for more information.
       </para>

     <para>Besides the Spring DM jars and the test itself is highly likely that you depend on 
     several libraries or your own code for the integration test.</para> 
     
     <para>Consider the following test that relies on Apache Commons 
     <ulink url="http://commons.apache.org/lang/">Lang</ulink>:</para>

     <para>The test requires <literal>org.apache.commons.lang.time</literal> package but there is no bundle
     that exports it. Let's fix this by installing a commons-lang bundle (make sure you use at least version 2.4

     <para>One can specify the bundles that she wants

     name, package and versioning through as a String while the latter returns an array of
     <literal>Resource</literal>s that can be used directly for installing the bundles.
     That is, use <literal>getTestBundlesNames</literal> when you rely on somebody else to locate
     (the most common case) the bundles and <literal>getTestBundles</literal> when you want to 
     locate the bundles yourself.
     </para>
     
     <para>By default, the test suite performs a lookup for artifacts, similar to the one used by 
     <ulink url="http://maven.apache.org">Maven2</ulink>, searching first the items as being relative to the 
     current project and then falling back to the local repository. 
     The locator expects the bundle String to be a comma separated values containing the artifact group, name, version and (optionally) type.
     
     It's likely that in the future, various other locators will be available. One can plug in their own 
     locator through the <interfacename>org.springframework.osgi.test.provisioning.ArtifactLocator</interfacename> interface.

      <para>A useful feature of the testing framework represents the automatic creation of the test manifest based on the test bundle content. The manifest 
      creator component uses byte-code analysis to determine the packages imported by the test classes so that it can generate the proper OSGi directives for them.
      Since the generated bundle is used for running a test, the creator will use the following assumptions:</para>
      
      <itemizedlist>
      	<listitem><para>No packages will be exported.</para> <para>The <emphasis>on-the-fly</emphasis> bundle is used for running a test which 
      	(usually) consumes OSGi packages for its execution. This behaviour can be changed by <link linkend="testing:integration:customize-manifest">customizing</link>

      	<para> 
      	This means that packages present in the test framework are considered complete and no <code>Import-Package</code> entry will be generated for them. 
      	To avoid this problem, consider using sub-packages or moving the classes inside one bundle. Note that split packages are discouraged due to the

      <para>A built-in feature of the testing framework is the ability to wait until all dependencies are deployed before
      starting the test execution. Since the OSGi platforms are concurrent by nature, installing a bundle doesn't mean that
      all its services are running. By running a test before its dependency services are fully initialized can cause sporadic
      errors that pollute the test results. By default, the testing framework inspects all bundles installed by the user and,
      if they are Spring-powered bundles, waits until they are fully started (that is their application context is published
      as an OSGi service). This behaviour can be disabled by overriding <literal>shouldWaitForSpringBundlesContextCreation</literal>

      has to be done anyway (such as creating the manifest or creating a bundle for the test or installing the bundles).
      Doing it manually simply does not work as it's too error prone and time consuming.

      about deployment problems and redundancy.</para> 
      <para>As for the numbers, the current infrastructure has been used internally for the last half a year - our integration tests

      framework" takes around 10% (as shown in our profiling so far).
      For example, the manifest generation has proved to take less then 0.5 seconds in general, while the jar creation around 1
      second.</para>
      <para>However, we are working on making it even faster and smarter so that less configuration options are needed and
      the contextual information available in your tests is used as much as possible. If you have any ideas or suggestion,
      feel free to use our issue tracker or/and forum.

    <para>Hopefully this chapter showed how Spring DM testing infrastructure can simplify OSGi integration testing and 
    how it can be customized. Consider consulting the javadocs for more information.
